# Volunteers, Not Conscripts: Fixing Out-of-Hours On-Call
Brian Scanlan (Intercom)


* Oncall is wonderful
  * Full stack ownership
  * incidents and outages are learning opportunities
* Oncall is terrible
  * Hard to commit to things when you have an unstable infrastructure
  * Panic/Depression


* Possible problems
  * Too many people oncall
  * Inconsistent quality and experience
    * Documentation/picking up the stack for new starts/team changes
  * Too many alerts
  * Tolerance for constant alerts (work life balance)
  * Burn out engineers


* How to fix
  1. Create virtual team of volunteers
    * Opt in to oncall, don't have to do it
    * Mix from all teams
  2. Define standards and processes for alarms
    * Setting thresholds realistically/sensibly
    * Peer review alarms
    * Run book for all alarms
  3. Move alarms over to virtual team
  4. Remunerate team members


* Oncall during working hours is done by the relevant team
* Out of hours oncall is done by the virtual team
* It's to stop the bleeding not to fix the problem
  * Follow the run books
  * Escalate if needed or leave till business hours
* Important to do oncall reasonably regularly
  * Context
  * Known issues
  * Tooling
* Rest is important
* Celebrate the team, shout outs


* Unexpected stuff
  * Escalation was unusual, people were around on slack etc
  * Teams took responsibility and were embarrassed when someone from outside the team had to react
  * Lots of low value alarms were thrown out after evaluation

* Delete a lot of your alarms!!
