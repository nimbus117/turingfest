# Sense & Respond: Continuously learning our way to better outcomes
Jeff Gothelf (Neo Innovation)

* 20 years ago
* Static software
  * Learning loops were long
  * Software adoption was slow
  * Impact was limited to the tech-savy
  * Work as designed was the goal
  * Shipping software was success


* Today
  * Software is continuous
  * Tesla software features and fixes are delivered OTA
  * Continuous feedback and improvement
  * Ship -> sense -> respond -> ship
    * Ship - smallest thing possible
    * Sense - how does it affect customer behaviour
    * Respond - what can we do about this


* Outcomes
  * Measurable changes in user behaviour
  * Pay attention to the marketplace
* The challenge is predicting behaviour
* Software systems are complex and unpredictable
  * Short cycles with feedback
  * Behaviour emerges through use and can't always be predicted
* Watch for new behaviours
  * Look for outcomes that are not being met
  * Evolve the system or expand into a new one


* Blindly optimising for metrics without considering real world implications is at best risky
* At worst, it's criminal


* When you enforce bad policy, people will work around those policies


* Goal driven. Values guided. Measure both


### For employees
1. Understad your business model
2. Take an interest in your customers
3. Use the software to learn
4. Measure the impact of your work
5. Discuss the dangerous edge cases
6. Refuse the work that harms people
