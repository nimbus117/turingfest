Randy Silver (Director, UK Insider Insights, Motivate Design)


* What is a product team?
  * A group of people that fills a need and serves a purpose 
  * A group of people that can
    * Ask a question
    * Get an answer
    * Understand the answer
    * Take an action based on the answer


* People are hard
* Lots of people are even harder
* Working at scale increases complexity


* Discovery
  * The process of finding information, especially for the first time
  * We aren't discovering anything (usually), we're learning
  * Learning
    * The activity of obtaining knowledge
  * What is discovery?
    * Which problem do we need to solve
    * How should we solve it
    * Have we solved it


* Insider Insight (make networks)
  * Conversations happen in the wild
  * People reveal the real with their real life connections
  * Use real people, voluntarily, one on one conversations with their friends
* Using the network
  * Pick one tough meaty question
  * Activate a network
  * Have a conversation
  * Listen and read
  * Find the insight


* Don't talk to customers during discovery, listen to them.


* Definition of success
  * Are your customers happy!
