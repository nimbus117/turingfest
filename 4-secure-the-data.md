# Donâ€™t Secure The Hardware, Secure the Data: Tackling Hard But Vital Problems
David Irvine (MaidSafe)


* How do we share data securely?
* Change is difficult and people don't always like it


* Server based infrastructure is lazy
  * Google, Facebook, Microsoft hold all our data because its easy
  * But they can use it to manipulate us


* Every server gets hacked
* Encrypt all data by default
* Encrypt the data, don't bother securing the server 
* Share all data and copy it everywhere
* Public data can be decrypted by anyone
* Computers are just bits of metal, we shouldn't think of owning the computer but owning the data


* Safe Network - https://safenetwork.tech/
* Think about what we're doing with technology - It's all about data
