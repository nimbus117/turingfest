Gabrielle Bufrem (Pivotal)


* Monsters are made by saying yes
  * Tech debt
  * No longer solve real issues


* Saying no leads to anger,frustration, yelling
  * Too many ways to reach you
  * Don't enable iteration


* Solution is strategy
  * Strategy magic is hard work
  * No single answer
  * It's a team sport


* Vision - where you want to go
  * not how to get there
